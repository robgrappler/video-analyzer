QUICKSTART FOR NEWBIES
================================================================================

How to apply these edits in DaVinci Resolve or Final Cut Pro:

SLOW MOTION:
  - Resolve: Right-click clip → Retime Controls → Speed → 50% (or 25%)
  - FCP: Select clip → Retime menu → Slow → 50%

ZOOM (Push-in):
  - Resolve: Inspector → Transform → Zoom → Add keyframes (1.0 → 1.2)
  - FCP: Select clip → Transform → Add keyframes to Scale

SOUND EFFECTS (SFX):
  - Layer SFX on separate audio track above natural sound
  - Reduce natural sound by -3 to -6 dB during SFX (audio ducking)
  - Common SFX: impact boom, whoosh, tension drone

COLOR GRADING:
  - Resolve: Color page → Apply LUT or adjust Contrast/Saturation
  - FCP: Color Board → Increase contrast, warmth for dominance
  - 'Punchy' = +10-20% contrast, slight saturation boost

TIMECODED EDITING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

[00:00:18 → 00:00:23] Opening Takedown & Scramble (Intensity: 3/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:
  • Speed Ramp: points=[{'time': '00:00:18', 'speed': 100}, {'time': '00:00:19', 'speed': 60}, {'time': '00:00:21', 'speed': 60}, {'time': '00:00:22', 'speed': 100}]
  • Sfx: sound=body_impact_mat, volume_db=-5, time=00:00:19

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  Establishes the initial aggression and power dynamic. Slowing the impact emphasizes the physicality and competitive balance, hooking viewers who value intense, realistic grappling.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Retime Curve: Keyframe speed ramp
  • Add SFX to A2 at impact point


[00:00:34 → 00:00:39] Triangle Choke Submission Threat (Intensity: 4/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:
  • Zoom: start_zoom=1.0, end_zoom=1.15, ease=ease_in_out
  • Sfx: sound=low_heartbeat, volume_db=-12, loop=True

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  Builds suspense and highlights a technical submission attempt. The slow zoom and heartbeat SFX create a sense of urgency and drama, appealing to fans who enjoy the 'chess match' aspect and high-stakes moments.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Transform: Keyframe Zoom from 1.0 to 1.15
  • Add 'Heartbeat' SFX on A2 for duration


[00:01:32 → 00:01:37] Dominant Pin & Victory Pose (Intensity: 5/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:

  • Color Grade: effect=increase_saturation, value=1.1

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  Provides a clear payoff and reinforces the winner's dominance. The slow-motion victory pose creates a powerful, memorable image that satisfies the narrative arc and appeals to fans of 'alpha' displays.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:

  • Vignette: softness=0.8, size=0.6

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  Focuses viewer attention on the danger of the submission. The tight crop and vignette eliminate distractions, amplifying the feeling of claustrophobia and tension, which is a major hook for submission-focused fans.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Transform: Zoom to 1.3 and reframe on the choke
  • OpenFX: Add Vignette, adjust size and softness
