QUICKSTART FOR NEWBIES
================================================================================

How to apply these edits in DaVinci Resolve or Final Cut Pro:

SLOW MOTION:
  - Resolve: Right-click clip → Retime Controls → Speed → 50% (or 25%)
  - FCP: Select clip → Retime menu → Slow → 50%

ZOOM (Push-in):
  - Resolve: Inspector → Transform → Zoom → Add keyframes (1.0 → 1.2)
  - FCP: Select clip → Transform → Add keyframes to Scale

SOUND EFFECTS (SFX):
  - Layer SFX on separate audio track above natural sound
  - Reduce natural sound by -3 to -6 dB during SFX (audio ducking)
  - Common SFX: impact boom, whoosh, tension drone

COLOR GRADING:
  - Resolve: Color page → Apply LUT or adjust Contrast/Saturation
  - FCP: Color Board → Increase contrast, warmth for dominance
  - 'Punchy' = +10-20% contrast, slight saturation boost

TIMECODED EDITING RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

[00:00:17 → 00:00:38] Round 1: Takedown to Crucifix Pin (Intensity: 4/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:
  • Speed Ramp: points=[{'time': '00:00:18', 'speed': 100}, {'time': '00:00:19', 'speed': 50}, {'time': '00:00:21', 'speed': 100}]
  • Slow Motion: factor=0.6, start_offset_s=18, end_offset_s=21
  • Sfx: type=low_thud, time=00:00:36, volume_db=-8

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  Highlights the initial power exchange and the surprising technical reversal. The slow motion on the pin emphasizes the sudden shift in dominance and the match-ending technique, creating a dramatic opening hook.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Retime Curve: Keyframe speed 100% -> 50% -> 100% around the takedown.
  • Retime Control: Set speed to 60% from 00:00:35 to 00:00:38.
  • Add SFX on Audio Track 2 at 00:00:36.


[00:00:57 → 00:01:12] Round 2: Dominant Takedown & Control (Intensity: 3/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:
  • Slow Motion: factor=0.7, ramp=ease_in
  • Zoom: start_zoom=1.0, end_zoom=1.15, ease=ease_out

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  Emphasizes the power and control of the takedown. The slow zoom builds tension and focuses the viewer on the dominant wrestler's control, appealing to fans of physical overpowering.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Retime Control: Set speed to 70%.
  • Transform: Keyframe Zoom from 1.0 to 1.15 over the clip duration.


[00:03:31 → 00:03:48] Technical Reversal into Pinning Combo (Intensity: 4/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:
  • Speed Ramp: points=[{'time': '00:03:31', 'speed': 100}, {'time': '00:03:33', 'speed': 60}, {'time': '00:03:36', 'speed': 100}]
  • Color Grade: effect=increase_contrast, value=1.2

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  The speed ramp highlights the speed and precision of the reversal. Increased contrast makes the sweat and muscle definition more prominent, enhancing the physical intensity of the struggle.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Retime Curve: Keyframe speed changes.
  • Color Page: Increase Contrast node to 1.200.


[00:06:31 → 00:06:41] Submission Threat: Foot Lock Scramble (Intensity: 4/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:
  • Crop Reframe: zoom=1.4, y_offset=-150
  • Audio Ducking: target=music/ambient, duck_by_db=-12, focus=breathing/grunts

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  A tight crop focuses attention on the technical details of the submission, creating suspense. Ducking the audio to highlight the sounds of struggle makes the moment more visceral and intense.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Transform: Zoom to 1.4 and adjust Y position to frame the legs.
  • Fairlight Page: Automate volume on music track to dip, raise dialogue/sfx track.


[00:07:58 → 00:08:03] Dominance Display: Chest Stand (Intensity: 5/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:
  • Slow Motion: factor=0.5
  • Sfx: type=low_rumble, volume_db=-10

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  This is a peak dominance moment. Slow motion and a subtle rumble SFX amplify the weight and impact of the action, creating a powerful visual that hooks viewers who appreciate displays of control and victory.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Retime Control: Set speed to 50%.
  • Add a low-frequency sound effect on a new audio track.


[00:11:15 → 00:11:21] Choke Threat: Rear Naked Choke (Intensity: 4/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:
  • Zoom: start_zoom=1.0, end_zoom=1.25, ease=ease_in_out
  • Vignette: softness=0.8, size=0.6

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  The slow zoom and vignette draw the viewer's eye directly to the choke, heightening the sense of claustrophobia and danger. This classic submission threat is a major point of tension and a key selling point.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Transform: Keyframe zoom.
  • Color Page: Add an oval Power Window, invert, and lower the Gamma outside the window.


[00:14:00 → 00:14:07] Power Reversal & Takedown (Intensity: 5/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:
  • Speed Ramp: points=[{'time': '00:14:00', 'speed': 100}, {'time': '00:14:02', 'speed': 40}, {'time': '00:14:04', 'speed': 100}]
  • Sfx: type=heavy_slam, time=00:14:03, volume_db=-6

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  This edit emphasizes a massive display of strength. The speed ramp slows down the peak of the lift and the impact, making the move feel more powerful and dramatic. It's a perfect 'wow' moment for a trailer.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Retime Curve: Create a 'U' shape to slow down the middle of the action.
  • Add a 'slam' SFX on Audio Track 2, synced with the impact.


[00:18:12 → 00:18:21] Match Finish: Exhaustion & KO (Intensity: 5/5)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TECHNIQUES:
  • Speed Ramp: points=[{'time': '00:18:12', 'speed': 100}, {'time': '00:18:14', 'speed': 30}, {'time': '00:18:16', 'speed': 100}]
  • Audio Ducking: target=all, duck_by_db=-20, focus=impact_sfx
  • Sfx: type=dull_thud_and_ring_out, time=00:18:14

WHY THIS WORKS FOR BUYERS:
  Maximizes the drama of the finish. The extreme slow-motion on the final blow, combined with muted audio and a sharp impact sound, creates a cinematic and definitive conclusion, providing a satisfying payoff for the viewer.

DAVINCI RESOLVE IMPLEMENTATION:
  • Retime Curve: Drastic speed drop at 00:18:14.
  • Fairlight Page: Automate a sharp volume drop on A1, add knockout SFX on A2.
